# RDVerre Front

This repo is the front-end repository for the crazy RDVerre project. It is a Flutter-framework app which allows you to add friends, enter their current positions, and then find the ideal meeting point which minimizes average travel time.

## TBD

- When deleting a user, the selected user is not deleted - on the contrary, it is always the last user that pops

- Suggesting location when starting to input

- Passing the information onto the next screen - making the "Let's go" button functional -> link with back-end at this point?
